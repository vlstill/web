            <p>I am a programmer in modern C++ and in Haskell. I live in Brno, Czechia. Currently, I work at Intel as a P4 compiler developer, enabling programmability of high-speed networking infrastructure such as switches. My previous experiences include teaching of programming and formal languages and research in the area of program analysis.</p>
<p>I studied at the <a href="https://fi.muni.cz">Faculty of Informatics of Masaryk University</a> since 2010 till 2020. From 2010 to 2013, I studied a bachelor in the field of computer networks and communication. After that, I continued with a master’s programme parallel and distributed systems. From 2016 to 2020, I studied Ph.D. with the topic of analysis of parallel C++ programs.</p>
<p>In my free time, I like to travel, walk in nature (especially in mountains), and to take photos of my travels. I also like to climb, mainly on indoor climbing walls. Furthermore, I organise games with <a href="https://instruktori.cz">Instruktoři Brno<span class="cz">(CZ)</span></a> and <a href="http://zverinec.fi.muni.cz/">Nordic Animals Association<span class="cz">(CZ)</span></a>.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-work-experience">Summary of Work Experience</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>2022–now</strong> – <strong>P4 Compiler Developer at <a href="https://intel.com">Intel</a></strong></p>
<p>At Intel, we are developing compilers that allow programming of network infrastructure hardware using the <a href="https://p4.org">P4</a> language. The compiler is written in C++ and based on the open-source <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/p4c">p4c</a> compiler. In this work, I am also occasionally contributing to the <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/p4c">p4c</a> itself.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2020–2022</strong> – <strong>Lecturer in Programming at <a href="https://fi.muni.cz">Faculty of Informatics of Masaryk University</a></strong></p>
<p>I was teaching courses related to programming (Haskell, C++, Python) and formal languages. I was also maintaining tools for the automatic evaluation of programming exercises in Haskell and formal languages, and I was responsible for homework assignments in these courses.</p>
<p>You can find more about my teaching on my <a href="teaching.html">teaching page</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2016–2020</strong> – <strong>Ph.D. Researcher in Program Analysis at <a href="https://fi.muni.cz">Faculty of Informatics of Masaryk University</a></strong></p>
<p>My <a href="phd/">Ph.D. research</a> was focused on the analysis of parallel C++ programs. In particular, my goal was to extend state of the art in model checking of realistic C++ programs with threads. I was one of the developers of the <a href="https://divine.fi.muni.cz">DIVINE</a> verification tool for analysis of C++ programs. The tool itself is written in C++ and based on the <a href="https://llvm.org">LLVM</a> compiler infrastructure.</p>
<p>You can find my Ph.D. thesis on my <a href="phd/">research page</a> and all my publications at the <a href="publications.html">publications page</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2011–2020</strong> – <strong>Teaching Assistant at <a href="https://fi.muni.cz">Faculty of Informatics of Masaryk University</a></strong></p>
<p>Already during my studies, I was teaching seminars at the faculty. My main topics included functional programming in Haskell, an advanced C++ programming (I was one of the creators of advanced C++ course at the faculty) and formal languages. In later years (since 2014), I have headed teams responsible for homework assignment creation and grading for functional programming and formal languages.</p>

<h2 id="my-projects">My Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>My current work is mainly on proprietary P4 compiler at Intel, but I occasionally contribute to the open-source <a href="https://github.com/p4lang/p4c">p4c</a> compiler.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vlstill/hsExprTest">hsExprTest</a>, a tool for automatic comparisons of Haskell expressions and <a href="https://github.com/vlstill/exprTest">ExprTest</a> which is a building block for testing short tasks in other programming languages. It is also used for non-programming short exercises in teaching of formal languages and statistics courses. These projects focus mostly on testing of students who are submitting their tasks through e-learning facilities in information system of Masaryk University. The project was first used in 2014 and I am extending it since then.</li>
<li>I am organizing free-time activities with <a href="https://instruktori.cz">Instruktoři Brno<span class="cz">(CZ)</span></a>, including <a href="https://zoo.instruktori.cz/">Escape from ZOO<span class="cz">(CZ)</span></a>.</li>
<li>I was also involved in organizing several free-time activities under the <a href="http://zverinec.fi.muni.cz/">Nordic Animals Association<span class="cz">(CZ)</span></a>, most importantly the <a href="https://interlos.fi.muni.cz">InterLoS<span class="cz">(CZ)</span></a> internet game with puzzles/ciphers and programming tasks (2013–2021), and <a href="https://ksi.fi.muni.cz">KSI<span class="cz">(CZ)</span></a> which is an online programming seminar for students who are thinking about studying computer science at the university (2015–2020).</li>
<li><a href="https://divine.fi.muni.cz">DIVINE</a>, a program analysis tool developed in the <a href="https://paradise.fi.muni.cz">ParaDiSe</a> laboratory. It focuses on analysis of C and C++ programs. DIVINE is a long team effort, I was part of the DIVINE development team between 2014 and 2020.</li>
