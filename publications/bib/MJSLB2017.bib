 abstract = {This paper presents a new version of the tool SymDIVINE, a model-checker for concurrent C/C++ programs. SymDIVINE uses a control-explicit data-symbolic approach to model checking, which allows for the bit-precise verification of programs with inputs, by representing data part of a program state by a first-order bit-vector formula. The new version of the tool employs a refined representation of symbolic states, which allows for efficient caching of smt queries. Moreover, the new version employs additional simplifications of first-order bit-vector formulas, such as elimination of unconstrained variables from quantified formulas. All changes are documented in detail in the paper.},
