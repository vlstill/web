This page gives you an overview of collaboration options if you wish to work
with me on [teaching](#teaching) or you want to do your bachelor or master
[thesis](#theses) with me as you supervisor.
You can write your e-mails to me in Czech or Slovak.

## Teaching and Homework Creation {#teaching}

The collaboration depends vastly on the course. For the following courses, your
can contact me directly once you have passed the prerequisites.

- **IB015 Nonimperative Programming** – *tutoring seminars and / or homework
  preparations* – you should pass both IB015 and IB016 Seminar
  in Functional Programming before you can start teaching IB015. Once you are
  nearing end of IB016, you can contact me to speak about teaching IB015.

- **IB016 Seminar in Functional Programming** – this course follows IB015 and
  therefore teaching this course should also follow teaching IB015 and ideally
  also preparation of homework for IB015.

- **IB005 Formal languages and Automata** – *homework preparation and marking*
  (if you wish to teach this course, please contact Jan Strejček) – you must
  have passed this course (or IB102 Automata and Grammars), passing IB107
  Computability and Complexity is an advantage.

- **PB173 Domain specific development in C/C++** – *tutoring your own group*
  – this course is a bit special as the groups are mostly independent.
  If you wish to open your own group for the topic of your choice, please
  contact me with the group proposal.

I have no minimal requirements for your teaching experience (but if you have
them it can be an advantage). I\ also have no minimal requirements for the study
phase you are in – you can be a\ bachelor student and teach in one of these
courses.

**You should contact me using the e-mail on my [IS
page](https://is.muni.cz/auth/osoba/373979).**
Please write the code of the course in the e-mail subject (e.g. "[IB015] …").
The ideal **time of contact** is during the semester before the one in which you
wish to teach or prepare homework.
For tutoring it should be at least one month before the teaching in that
semester ends – this constraint is due to the timetable creation constraints. For
homework creation the times are a bit more lax, but I\ usually tend to finalize
the teams in early January for spring semester and in June for autumn.

**For the remaining courses** you should contact their respective main lecturer
or guarantor of tutorials.

## Bachelor and Master Theses {#theses}

My areas of interest in regards to qualification theses include C++, Haskell
(and possibly other functional-programming-related topics), and systems for
automatic evaluation and marking of exercises (both for programming and for
formal languages courses).
You can come up with your own topic idea, or we can discuss what of the topics
I do could be interesting for you.
Since the final thesis is quite a long-term work, you should first contact me
about the thesis roughly a year before you wish to submit the thesis (you can,
of course, contact me even earlier if you wish to start early).

**You should contact me using the e-mail on my [IS
page](https://is.muni.cz/auth/osoba/373979).**
The e-mail subject should indicate that you are interested in a\ bachelor or
master thesis (e.g.\ "[Bc thesis] …"/"[Bc práce] …") and the topic or area of
your interest.
