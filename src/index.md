My name is Vladimír Štill and I am a Ph.D. candidate at Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic.
My research topic is program analysis, more specifically analysis of parallel programs written in C and C++.
I do my work on the [DIVINE][divine] model checker.
My most important contribution so far was adding support for discovery of bugs caused by relaxed memory behaviour.
This also resulted in a publication [Model Checking of C++ Programs Under the x86-TSO Memory Model](https://divine.fi.muni.cz/2018/x86tso/).
Apart from Ph.D. research I am also involved in teaching several courses on our faculty, mostly in programming and formal languages.
I also maintain an evaluation engine for programming courses, [hsExprTest](https://github.com/vlstill/hsExprTest).
You can find more information about my research on the website of the [DIVINE][divine] model checker and about my other work mostly on my [GitHub](https://github.com/vlstill).

My hobbies include programming (mostly in C++ and Haskell), photography of nature, walking, and organizing games with my friends from [Nordic Animals Association (CZ)](http://zverinec.fi.muni.cz/).
