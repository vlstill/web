My name is Vladimír Štill and I am a lecturer at Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic.
I work on a variety of courses mainly on programming (C++, Python, Haskell, …) and also in formal languages and theory of programming.
Furthermore, I maintain an evaluation engine for programming courses, [hsExprTest][hsExprTest].

Before my position as a lecturer I did my Ph.D. on the topic of program analysis, more specifically analysis of parallel programs written in C and C++.
This work included research of new analysis techniques and their implementation in the [DIVINE][divine] model checker.
My most important contribution is adding support for discovery of bugs
caused by relaxed memory behaviour (published as [Model Checking of C++ Programs
Under the x86-TSO Memory Model](https://divine.fi.muni.cz/2018/x86tso/)) and for
detection of local nontermination in parallel programs (published as [Local
Nontermination Detection for Parallel C++
Programs](https://divine.fi.muni.cz/2019/lnterm/)).
You can see more of my publications of the [publications' page](publications.html).
You can also see my Ph.D. thesis on [the corresponding page](phd/).


My hobbies include programming (mostly in C++, Python, Perl, and Haskell), walking, photography of nature, and organizing games with my friends from [Nordic Animals Association<span class="cz">(CZ)</span>][zverinec].

## Teaching

* [IB015 Non-Imperative Programming](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/podzim2020/IB015?lang=en) ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/podzim2020/IB015))
    Currenlty (since 2020) I am responsible for the seminars and homework in
    this course and I also teach a few seminards.
    I was also teaching several seminar groups from 2011 to 2016, and I lead the
    team responsible for creating of homework since 2014.

* [PV264 Avanced programming in C++](https://www.fi.muni.cz/pv264/)
  ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/podzim2020/PV264?lang=en))
    A course focusing on modern techniques in C++ and advanced knowledge of this programming language.
    I was one of the founders of this course, I am teaching it since its start in 2017.
    Before this course, we had covered parts of its topics as part of [PB173 Domain specific development in C/C++](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2016/PB173?lang=en) since 2014.

* [IB111 Foundations of Programming](https://is.muni.cz/course/fi/autumn2020/IB111)
  ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/course/fi/autumn2020/IB111),
   [Czech course page](https://www.fi.muni.cz/ib111/))
   I am a seminar tutor for this course since 2020.

* [PB161 C++ Programming](https://www.fi.muni.cz/pb161/) ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/jaro2020/PB161))
    I am a seminar tutor for this course and I was lecturing the first four lectures in spring 2020.

* [PB006 Principles of Programming Languages and OOP](https://is.muni.cz/course/fi/autumn2020/PB006?lang=en)
  ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/course/fi/autumn2020/PB006))
  I am responsible for homework for this course in 2020.

* [IB016 Seminar on Functional Programming](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2019/IB016?lang=en) ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/jaro2016/IB016))
    Since 2021 I am teaching some of the seminars and I was teaching
    this course from 2015 to 2019 and built it to its current state with Martin
    Ukrop.

* [IB005 Formal Languages and Automata](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2020/IB005?lang=en) ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/jaro2020/IB005))
    I lead the team responsible for creating of homework since 2020.

* [IB102 Automata and Grammars](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/podzim2019/IB102?lang=en) ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/podzim2019/IB102))
    I was teaching several seminar groups from 2015 to 2016, and until termination of the course I lead the team responsible for creating of homework.

*   I had also minor involvement in other courses, such as [PB071 Introduction to the C language](https://is.muni.cz/course/fi/autumn2012/PB071) (seminar tutor, homework author; 2012), [PB161 C++ Programming](https://is.muni.cz/course/fi/autumn2018/PB161) (homework author, backup lecturer; 2016--2018), and [IA006 Selected topics on automata theory](https://is.muni.cz/course/fi/autumn2017/IA006) (marking exams; 2016--2017).

## My Projects

*   [hsExprTest][hsExprTest], a tool for automatic comparisons of Haskell expressions and a building block for testing other programming languages.
    It focuses mostly on testing of students who are submitting their tasks through e-learning facilities in information system of Masaryk University.
    The project was first used in 2014 and I am extending it since then.
*   I am involved in organizing several free-time activities under the [Nordic Animals Association<span class="cz">(CZ)</span>][zverinec], most importantly the [InterLoS<span class="cz">(CZ)</span>](https://interlos.fi.muni.cz) internet game with puzzles/ciphers and programming tasks, and [KSI<span class="cz">(CZ)</span>](https://ksi.fi.muni.cz) which is an online programming seminar for students who are thinking about studying computer science at the university.
-   [DIVINE][divine], a program analysis tool developed in the [ParaDiSe](https://paradise.fi.muni.cz) laboratory.
    It focuses on analysis of C and C++ programs.
    DIVINE is a long team effort, I was part of the DIVINE development team between 2014 and 2020.
*   More of my projects can be found on my [GitHub page][github].
