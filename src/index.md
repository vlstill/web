I am programmer in modern C++ and in Haskell.
I live in Brno, Czechia.
Currently I work at Intel as P4 compiler developer, enabling programmability of high-speed
networking infrastructure such as switches.
My previous experiences include teaching of programming and formal languages and research in the
area of program analysis.

In my free time, I like to travel and walk in nature (especially in mountains) and to take photos of
my travels.
I also like to climb, mainly on indoor climbing walls.
Furthermore, I am organizing games with [Instruktoři Brno<span
class="cz">(CZ)</span>][instruktori] and [Nordic Animals Association<span
class="cz">(CZ)</span>][zverinec].

## Summary of Work Experience

* **2022–now** – **P4 Compiler Developer at [Intel](https://intel.com)**

  At Intel, we are developing compilers that allow programming of network infrastructure hardware
  using the [P4](https://p4.org) language.
  The compiler is written in C++ and based on the open source [p4c]
  compiler.
  In this work, I am also occasionally contributing to the [p4c] itself.

* **2020–2022** – **Lecturer in Programming at [Faculty of Informatics of Masaryk
  University][fimu]**

  I was teaching courses related to programming (Haskell, C++, Python) and formal languages.
  I was also maintaining tools for automatic evaluation of programming exercises in Haskell and
  formal languages and I was responsible for homework assignments in these courses.

  You can find more about my teaching at my [teaching page](teaching.html).

* **2016–2020** – **Ph.D. Researcher in Program Analysis at
  [Faculty of Informatics of Masaryk University][fimu]**

  My [Ph.D. research](phd/) was focused on analysis of parallel C++ programs.
  In particular my goal was to extend the state of the art in model checking of realistic C++
  programs with threads.
  I was one of the developers of the [DIVINE] verification tool for analysis of C++ programs.
  The tool itself is written in C++ and based on the [LLVM] compiler infrastructure.

  You can find my Ph.D. thesis at my [research page](phd/) and all my publications at the
  [publications page](publications.html).

* **2011–2020** – **Teaching Assistant at [Faculty of Informatics of Masaryk University][fimu]**

  Already during my studies, I was teaching seminars at the faculty.
  My main topics included functional programming in Haskell, advanced C++ programming (I was one of
  the creators of advanced C++ course at the faculty) and formal languages.
  In later years (since 2014) I have headed teams responsible for homework assignment creation and
  grading for functional programming and formal languages.

## My Projects

*   My current work is mainly on proprietary P4 compiler at Intel, but I occasionally contribute to
    the open-source [p4c] compiler.
*   [hsExprTest][hsExprTest], a tool for automatic comparisons of Haskell expressions and
    [ExprTest] which is a building block for testing short tasks in other programming languages.
    It is also used for non-programming short exercises in teaching of formal languages and
    statistics courses.
    These projects focus mostly on testing of students who are submitting their tasks through
    e-learning facilities in information system of Masaryk University.
    The project was first used in 2014 and I am extending it since then.
*   I am organizing free-time activities with [Instruktoři Brno<span
    class="cz">(CZ)</span>][instruktori], including [Escape from ZOO<span
    class="cz">(CZ)</span>](https://zoo.instruktori.cz/).
*   I was also involved in organizing several free-time activities under the
    [Nordic Animals Association<span class="cz">(CZ)</span>][zverinec],
    most importantly the [InterLoS<span class="cz">(CZ)</span>](https://interlos.fi.muni.cz)
    internet game with puzzles/ciphers and programming tasks (2013–2021), and
    [KSI<span class="cz">(CZ)</span>](https://ksi.fi.muni.cz) which is an online programming seminar
    for students who are thinking about studying computer science at the university (2015–2020).
-   [DIVINE][divine], a program analysis tool developed in the
    [ParaDiSe](https://paradise.fi.muni.cz) laboratory.  It focuses on analysis of C and C++
    programs.
    DIVINE is a long team effort, I was part of the DIVINE development team between 2014 and 2020.
