My name is Vladimír Štill and I am a Ph.D. candidate at Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic.
My research topic is program analysis, more specifically analysis of parallel programs written in C and C++.
My work includes research of new analysis techniques and their implementation in the [DIVINE][divine] model checker.
My most important contribution so far was adding support for discovery of bugs
caused by relaxed memory behaviour (published as [Model Checking of C++ Programs
Under the x86-TSO Memory Model](https://divine.fi.muni.cz/2018/x86tso/)) and for
detection of local nontermination in parallel programs (published as [Local
Nontermination Detection for Parallel C++
Programs](https://divine.fi.muni.cz/2019/lnterm/)).
You can see more of my publications of the [publications' page](publications.html).

Apart from Ph.D. research I am also involved in teaching several courses on our faculty, mostly in programming and formal languages.
Furthermore, I maintain an evaluation engine for programming courses, [hsExprTest][hsExprTest].

My hobbies include programming (mostly in C++, Haskell, and Python), photography of nature, walking, and organizing games with my friends from [Nordic Animals Association<span class="cz">(CZ)</span>][zverinec].

## My Projects

-   [DIVINE][divine], a program analysis tool developed in the [ParaDiSe](https://paradise.fi.muni.cz) laboratory.
    It focuses on analysis of C and C++ programs.
    DIVINE is a long team effort, I am part of the DIVINE development team since 2014.
*   [hsExprTest][hsExprTest], a tool for automatic comparisons of Haskell expressions and a building block for testing other programming languages.
    It focuses mostly on testing of students who are submitting their tasks through e-learning facilities in information system of Masaryk University.
    The project was first used in 2014 and I am extending it since then.
*   I am involved in organizing several free-time activities under the [Nordic Animals Association<span class="cz">(CZ)</span>][zverinec], most importantly the [InterLoS<span class="cz">(CZ)</span>](https://interlos.fi.muni.cz) internet game with puzzles/ciphers and programming tasks, and [KSI<span class="cz">(CZ)</span>](https://ksi.fi.muni.cz) which is an online programming seminar for students who are thinking about studying computer science at the university.
*   More of my projects can be found on my [GitHub page][github].

## Teaching

* [PV264 Avanced programming in C++](https://www.fi.muni.cz/pv264/) ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/jaro2019/PV264))
    A course focusing on modern techniques in C++ and advanced knowledge of this programming language.
    I was one of the founders of this course, I am teaching it since its start in 2017.
    Before this course, we had covered parts of its topics as part of [PB173 Domain specific development in C/C++](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2016/PB173?lang=en) since 2014.

* [IB015 Non-Imperative Programming](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/podzim2019/IB015?lang=en) ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/podzim2019/IB015))
    I was teaching several seminar groups from 2011 to 2016, right now I lead the team responsible for creating of homework.

* [PB161 C++ Programming](https://www.fi.muni.cz/pb161/) ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/jaro2020/PB161))
    I was lecturing the first four lectures in spring 2020.

* [IB016 Seminar on Functional Programming](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2019/IB016?lang=en) ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/jaro2016/IB016))
    I was teaching this course from 2015 to 2019 and built it to its current state with Martin Ukrop.

* [IB005 Formal Languages and Automata](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2020/IB005?lang=en) ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/jaro2020/IB005))
    I lead the team responsible for creating of homework.

* [IB102 Automata and Grammars](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/podzim2019/IB102?lang=en) ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/podzim2019/IB102))
    I was teaching several seminar groups from 2015 to 2016, and until termination of the course I lead the team responsible for creating of homework.

*   I had also minor involvement in other courses, such as [PB071 Introduction to the C language](https://is.muni.cz/course/fi/autumn2012/PB071) (seminar tutor, homework author; 2012), [PB161 C++ Programming](https://is.muni.cz/course/fi/autumn2018/PB161) (homework author, backup lecturer; 2016--2018), and [IA006 Selected topics on automata theory](https://is.muni.cz/course/fi/autumn2017/IA006) (marking exams; 2016--2017).
