During my years at [Faculty of Informatics of Masaryk University](https://fi.muni.cz) (2010–2022) I
was teaching various courses related to programming and formal languages.

* [IB015 Non-Imperative Programming](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/podzim2020/IB015?lang=en) ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/podzim2020/IB015))
    In years 2020 to 2022 I was responsible for the seminars and homework in
    this course and I also taught a few seminars.
    I was also teaching several seminar groups from 2011 to 2016, and I lead the
    team responsible for creating of homework since 2014.

* [PV264 Avanced programming in C++](https://www.fi.muni.cz/pv264/)
  ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/podzim2020/PV264?lang=en))
    A course focusing on modern techniques in C++ and advanced knowledge of this programming language.
    I was one of the founders of this course, I was teaching it since its start in 2017 till its
    last run in 2020.
    Before this course, we had covered parts of its topics as part of [PB173 Domain Specific
    Development in C/C++](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2016/pb173?lang=en) since 2014.

* [IB016 Seminar on Functional Programming](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2019/IB016?lang=en) ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/jaro2016/IB016))
  I was teaching this course since 2015 when I have rebuilt it together with Martin Ukrop.
  This course focuses of more practical aspects of the Haskell programming language.
  I was last teaching it in 2022.
    Since 2021 I am teaching some of the seminars and I was teaching this course from 2015 to 2019
    and built it to its current state with Martin Ukrop.

* [PB173 Domain Specific Development](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2021/pb173?lang=en)
  ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/jaro2021/pb173?lang=en))
  From 2021 to 2022 I was guarantor of the course.
  From 2014 to 2016 I was seminar tutor for the topic of Modern C++.

* [IB111 Foundations of Programming](https://is.muni.cz/course/fi/autumn2020/IB111)
  ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/course/fi/autumn2020/IB111),
   [Czech course page](https://www.fi.muni.cz/ib111/))
   I was a seminar tutor for this course in years 2020 and 2021.

* [PB161 C++ Programming](https://www.fi.muni.cz/pb161/) ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/jaro2020/PB161))
    I was a seminar tutor for this course and I was lecturing the first four lectures in spring 2020.
    I was also backup lecturer from 2016 to 2018.

* [PB006 Principles of Programming Languages and OOP](https://is.muni.cz/course/fi/autumn2020/PB006?lang=en)
  ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/course/fi/autumn2020/PB006))
  I was responsible for homework for this course in 2020.

* [IB005 Formal Languages and Automata](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/jaro2020/IB005?lang=en) ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/jaro2020/IB005))
  I was leading the team responsible for creating of homework from 2020 to 2022.

* [IB102 Automata and Grammars](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/podzim2019/IB102?lang=en) ([IS](https://is.muni.cz/auth/predmet/fi/podzim2019/IB102))
    I was teaching several seminar groups from 2015 to 2016, and until termination of the course I lead the team responsible for creating of homework.

*   I had also minor involvement in other courses, such as [PB071 Introduction to the C language](https://is.muni.cz/course/fi/autumn2012/PB071) (seminar tutor, homework author; 2012), and [IA006 Selected topics on automata theory](https://is.muni.cz/course/fi/autumn2017/IA006) (marking exams; 2016--2017).
